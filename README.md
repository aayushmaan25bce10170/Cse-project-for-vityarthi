MONTHLY BUDGET PLANNER

OVERVIEW:

This is a simple command-line, monthly budgeting planner created in Python. It assists the user in parceling out their total month-on-month income through various expense categories by inputting the percentage of income for each category. The program then calculates and outputs the amount apportioned to each category, coupled with the remaining balance. Users can iteratively alter their expense percentages until they attain a desirable budget.

FEATURES:

- Input total monthly income.
- Enter the percentage of expenses for categories like Rent, Groceries, Utilities, Transport, and Others.
View calculated expense amounts and remaining balance.
- Edit expense percentages interactively.
- Validates input to ensure meaningful and realistic budget allocation.

TECHNOLOGIES/TOOLS:

- Python 3.x
- Console-based interaction, no GUI frameworks.
STEPS TO INSTALL AND RUN:

1. Python 3 should be installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the program using: Ctrl+Alt+N.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESTING:

- Run the program and input your total monthly income.
Input percentages for each expense category. Percentages must be realistic, that is, not more than 100%.
- Once the summary is displayed, confirm whether you would like to edit any of the percentage values. If yes, type in the category name and new percentage. - Continue editing until you type 'no' to the prompt for whether you want to edit. -Check that the amounts and remaining balance tally with your inputs. Feel free to extend the project by adding more categories, saving/loading budgets, or even creating a graphical interface!
